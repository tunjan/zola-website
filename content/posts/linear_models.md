Linear models, though old-fashioned and full of assumptions about the data, provide a significant amount of interpretability.
I define interpretability as the extent to which one is able to make accurate inferences from the model itself.
On simple linear models, of the form

<div>$${\hat{y}_i = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 x_{i1} + \hat{\beta}_2 x_{i2} + \cdots + \hat{\beta}_p x_{ip} + \epsilon_i}$$</div>
