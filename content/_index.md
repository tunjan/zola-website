## About

I very much enjoy learning and teaching science, mathematics, statistics and physics.
Having previous experience as a private tutor in those subjects, and making sure people understand the historical background
and why some individuals (including me) find it so interesting.

Almost every weekend, I participate in animal rights educational activism.

When I code, I usually upload it [here](https://github.com/tunjan).
