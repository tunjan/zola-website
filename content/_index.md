I very much enjoy learning and teaching science, mathematics, statistics and physics.
Having tutored those subjects privately before, I always try to give the historical
context behind concepts - why they were developed and what makes them so fascinating
to certain people like me. Understanding that bigger picture is key to truly grasping them.

Almost every weekend, I participate in animal rights educational activism.

When I code, I usually upload it [here](https://github.com/tunjan).
