# Alberto Trigo

I am currently a part-time Bachelor’s physics student. This fact reflects my interests in mathematics, science, computers and statistics.
 
I have proffesional training as data scientist, specifically in the subfield of machine learning engineering. 

Most of my days are spent reading, directly correlated with the long-term goal to have a broad and rigorous understanding of many disciplines. 

Occasionally, I contribute to Wikipedia and open-source projects. 

If you want to discuss, you can send me an [email](mailto:trigo@inventati.org), or tag me on [mastodon](https://scicomm.xyz/@tunjan).

**Note**: this page is subject to constant change. Expect the content to change on a weekly basis.
