# About

Welcome to my little spot on the internet. As is obvious to many of us, introductions are rather limiting and reductionist.
Humans are difficult beings to understand, even harder to describe them accurately.
Nonetheless, I venture into the task of doing that to myself, and in my failure I ask the reader not to judge it harshly.

While general and broad, my main interests are science, mathematics, statistics and languages.

More specifically, I enjoy physics. Not the least because of the pleasure of grouping
multiple phenomena under a few mathematical principles.

Statistics have, in terms of hours spent learning, disproportionately improved my ability to make accurate,
or predictably inaccurate inferences from evidence and experience.

As for the other two interests, their explanations are left as an exercise for the reader. In any case, any set of interests can be effectively
subdivided into an infinite amount of subinterests, so I hope they offer an overall picture of what I find interesting to think and talk about.


As regards my cultural background, I was born in the south of Spain and currently reside in Poland, too cold of a country for my taste.
I do not hold any one country in high regards, but align the most with European values.
There is not much to say about my childhood, it was rather normal by today's working-class standards.

One of my long-term goals is having a broad and deep understanding of many science fields — including social sciences —
and find insights in their intersections. This will, in turn, help me create a more accurate model of the world, complex as it is, and express
ideas otherwise inaccessible before. 

In future writing I may decide to write about topics I find interesting, or keep talking about myself. This should not be seen
in a bad light, since after all, this is my own place.
