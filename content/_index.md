title  = 'Alberto Trigo'
+++

I am currently doing a Bachelorâ€™s physics degree. This reflects my interests in mathematics, science, computers and statistics.
 
I have professional training as data scientist, specifically in the sub-field of machine learning engineering. 

I spend most of my day reading, solving problems, and designing websites.
One of my long-term goals is to have a broad and rigorous understanding of many disciplines and be able to find their intersections. 

Occasionally, I contribute to Wikipedia and open-source projects.

My favourite programming languages are Julia and Rust, although I mainly use Python.
